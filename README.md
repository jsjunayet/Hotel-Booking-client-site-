##  5 Project features my hostal booking website
- My website is a hotel booking website in which I can book rooms.
- If you want to book a room on this website then you must have a user login otherwise you will not be able to book the room and if you want a room you can cancel one day in advance.
-By clicking on the update button here we can update the products and by clicking on the details button we must be logged in. Amar has turned on the authentication system here so we must be logged in then we can see the details.
- Moreover, if a user wants, he can push the date I mean anyone can change their previous date if they want.
- After booking a user's room, he can leave a review and his reviews will be visible to everyone on the Home Details router
- A user can book different rooms multiple times on this website But of course, that user can make this booking, if any other user wants to book and does not have login, then he will not be able to make the booking.
